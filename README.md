# odin-recipes

This is the first TOP Foundations Project that I will be working on. Furthermore - this will be the first project that I work on, ever. 

    This project is called 'Recipes'
    Main goals:
    -Create a basic html website that includes:
        - A main index.html landing page
        - Links to 3 separate pages
        - These will be 3 different recipes, for 3 different dishes.
        - Each page should have img of finished dish
        - Each have a 'Description' paragraph or two
        - Each have a 'unordered list' of ingredients
        - Each have a 'ordered list' of instructions or 'steps'

Main skills portrayed:
    -HTML boilerplate
    -<h1-6> , <p> , <img> , <src> , <href> , <strong> , <em> , <a>
    -Show basic concept of linking multiple pages to one main page, with ability to go backwards to index

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Miso Soup</strong> is a <em>delicious</em>, <em>warming</em> and <em>savoury</em> dish that can seem difficult to make on your own at home. Today, we will go over some simple ingredients and instructions to make miso soup all by yourself! This gives you an excellent dish to make at home without the financial burden of going out to a exotic restaurant. Let's get started!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Kombu Kelp</strong> - This will be used to make a very simple and quick broth named <strong><em>dashi</em></strong></li>
        <li><strong>White Miso Paste</strong> - Generally the sweetest tasting miso paste, making it perfect for Miso Soup.</li>
        <li><strong>Silken Tofu</strong> - Ideal because of its super-smooth texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Wakame</strong> - Dried seaweed that expands like crazy once soaked in warm water.</li>
        <li><strong>Scallions</strong> - Add texture and onion flavour.</li>
        <li><strong>Tamari</strong> - A sauce that gives extra flavour for serving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>We will begin making this simple dish by first making the dashi.</strong> Rinse the kombu and gently simmer it in a pot over low heat, but do not bring to a boil. Let simmer for 10 minutes, then remove and discard the kombu.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>As the dashi is simmering, quickly rehydrate the wakame.</strong> To do this, you place it in a medium bowl, cover it with warm water and set it aside for 5 mintues. It will grow like crazy!</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>The next step is to make the miso slurry.</strong> Put some of the hot dashi in a small bowl, add the miso paste, and whisk until it is smooth. </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Lastly, you just add the miso mixture to the rest of the dashi broth!</strong> Drain the wakame and also put it in the soup, along with green onions and tofu. Simmer it once more over low heat for a minute or two, and voila! Your soup is ready to be served, and do not forget to serve it with tamari for taste!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Vegetable tempura</strong> is a very popular vegetarian dish that accompanies Japanese cuisine, typically as an appetizer or side dish. It consists of deep-fried, battered vegetables, using potato starch to keep the batter light, and baking soda to puff it up. Cold water is essential in the cooking process, as it keeps the coating light and crisp.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 to 3 cups assorted vegetables (sweet potatoes, broccoli, mushroom caps, string beans, eggplant, bell pepper)</li><br>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flower</li><br>
            <li>2 tablespoons potato starch</li><br>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li><br>
            <li>1 large egg</li><br>
            <li>1 cup ice-cold water</li><br>
            <li>2 cups oil, for frying (canola, peanut, or sunflower oil)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li><br>
            <li>Prepare vegetables to fry them. Have 2 to 3 cups of vegetables, all trimmed, stemmed, and cut into uniform 2-inch pieces for even frying.</li><br>
            <li>Once your vegetables are prepared, whisk together the flour, potato starch, and baking soda in a small mixing bowl.</li><br>
            <li>Beat the egg and cold water together in a large mixing bowl, then gradually add in the flour mixture 1/3 cup at a time until just combined. <strong>Do not over-mix the batter, it will make the coating dense instead of light and crunchy!</strong> Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot to 350F.</li><br>
            <li>When the oil is hot, dip vegetables into the batter, allowing most of the batter to drip off back into the bowl, then drop them carefully into the oil in small batches. This will ensure uniform cooking times.</li><br>
            <li>Fry for 2 1/2 minutes on each side, flipping once, or until crisp and golden brown. Remove the vegetables from the oil and drain on paper towels.</li><br>
            <li>Repeat with remaining vegetables and batter. </li><br>
            <li>Serve warm and enjoy your light, crispy and delicious snack!</li>

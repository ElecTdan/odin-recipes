        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Japanese cream stew with chicken and broccoli</strong> is a great example of Western cuisine being adapted into something uniquely Japanese. It consists of a cream or dairy-based broth that is slightly thickened and includes proteins such as chicken or pork, fish, seafood, and vegetables. Today, we will be learning how to make this stew from scratch at home.
